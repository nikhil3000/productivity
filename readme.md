Productivity

@author : Nikhil yadav

A fun project I made to try some of the solidity concepts. It is meant to put in the number of hours(honestly) you put in a day for productive work and send 0.25 ethers with it to the contract. After getting two entries the contract will send all the ethers it has to the person who worked more. 

I have hard coded both our addresses in this contract. You can put in your address in the contract to try it out. Just don't forget to deploy your contract(you can use remix) and update the contract address in js file.

caution: As i have already mentioned that this was a fun project, there are many loop holes in this contract.
